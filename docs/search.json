    "text": "As members of the Listing Legends team, our project explored the impact of property characteristics such as type, location, and availability, and host reputation, including reviews and the number of listings, on Airbnb pricing in NYC. Our analysis draws on data from 2019 and 2023 that we retrived from Kaggle.\nMy specific question for this project was to focus on the influence of the Airbnb listing locations on the price per night. When landlords and tenants list their home or a room of their apartment on Airbnb, the general motivation to determine the price per night is to cover a part of the amount of rent they pay per month or the mortgage they need to reimburse. That is why I chose to compare the average price per night per neighborhood group on Airbnb to the average median asking rent per borough in New York City. StreetEasy provides data about the housing market of NYC from 2010 to 2024."

Visualization\nAfter our data has been downloaded and unzip in our files, we can start visualizing our data. I chose to code bar charts to visualize the data that we are going to analyze because it is easy to interpret and clearly show differences in values between groups, helping to analyze trends over time. To code my bar charts visuals, I chose to use the function plot_ly() from the Plotly() library. The visualizations created with Plotly are highly interactive, meaning users can hover over elements to get more information, zoom in or out on the plot, and explore the data in a more dynamic way compared to static charts.\nOur columns in the StreetEasy datasets are named as following “2010-01”. So we first have the Year and then the Month number. In order to be able to regroup only the values for 2019 and 2023, I used the pivot_longer() function to “melt” the dataframe, transforming the wide-format data with columns for each month into a long-format structure. This makes it easier to group, filter, and summarize the data by borough. The long format also simplifies plotting and statistical operations, as it aligns each value with its corresponding borough and time period in a single column.

    "text": "Kaggle Airbnb Data Manipulation\n\n1. Data Downloading\nFor the data collected from Kaggle, I dowloaded the data sets directly from the Kaggle website. We use for 2019 the data set from the Kaggle project New York City Airbnb Open Data, and for 2023, we took the data set New York City Airbnb 2023, Public Data. Both of those Kaggle projects took their data from Inside Airbnb. This website provides a lot of different data about Airbnb but getting that data is not free, that is why we chose to download those data sets from Kaggle.\nOnce the data sets are downloaded into our files, we can start building our visual.\n\n\n2. Visualization\nFor my visual, I am going to focus on the columns “price” and “neighborhood_group”. After exploring the details of the values inside those columns, I realized that the column “price” has very high values. This might be explained by the fact that there are in NYC some more high-end Airbnb listing and therefor it attracts the average night price up which can make our observations not really accurate as most of those luxury listings are mostly based in Manhattan. To have a more realistic visual, I decided to handle those outliers and replace them by the mean so that we do not drop all those listing numbers.\nHere is the code to handle the outliers and create the visual:\n\n# Step 1: Load the datasets\ndf_2019 &lt;- read_csv('AB_NYC_2019.csv')\ndf_2023 &lt;- read_csv('NYC-Airbnb-2023.csv')\n\n# Step 2: Replace outliers in the 'price' column with the mean\nreplace_outliers_with_mean &lt;- function(df, column, lower_quantile = 0.05, upper_quantile = 0.95) {\n  lower_bound &lt;- quantile(df[[column]], lower_quantile)\n  upper_bound &lt;- quantile(df[[column]], upper_quantile)\n  mean_value &lt;- mean(df[[column]][df[[column]] &gt;= lower_bound & df[[column]] &lt;= upper_bound])\n  df[[column]] &lt;- ifelse(df[[column]] &lt; lower_bound | df[[column]] &gt; upper_bound, mean_value, df[[column]])\n  return(df)\n}\n\ndf_2019_clean &lt;- replace_outliers_with_mean(df_2019, 'price')\ndf_2023_clean &lt;- replace_outliers_with_mean(df_2023, 'price')\n\n# Step 3: Calculate average price per neighborhood_group\navg_price_2019 &lt;- df_2019_clean %&gt;%\n  group_by(neighbourhood_group) %&gt;%\n  summarize(price = mean(price))\n\navg_price_2023 &lt;- df_2023_clean %&gt;%\n  group_by(neighbourhood_group) %&gt;%\n  summarize(price = mean(price))\n\n# Step 4: Create bar charts for 2019 and 2023\ncolor_map &lt;- c(\n  'Manhattan' = '#7FD4C1',\n  'Brooklyn' = '#30BFDD',\n  'Queens' = '#8690FF',\n  'Bronx' = '#ACD0F4',\n  'Staten Island' = '#F7C0BB'\n)\n\nfig_2019 &lt;- plot_ly(avg_price_2019, x = ~neighbourhood_group, y = ~price, type = 'bar',\n                    color = ~neighbourhood_group, colors = color_map) %&gt;%\n  layout(title = 'Average Airbnb Price by Neighborhood Group in NYC (2019)&lt;br&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Data from Airbnb&lt;/sup&gt;',\n         xaxis = list(title = 'Neighborhood Group'),\n         yaxis = list(title = 'Average Price ($)'),\n         plot_bgcolor = 'white',\n         paper_bgcolor = 'white',\n         width = 600,\n         height = 600)\n\nfig_2023 &lt;- plot_ly(avg_price_2023, x = ~neighbourhood_group, y = ~price, type = 'bar',\n                    color = ~neighbourhood_group, colors = color_map) %&gt;%\n  layout(title = 'Average Airbnb Price by Neighborhood Group in NYC (2023)&lt;br&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Data from Airbnb&lt;/sup&gt;',\n         xaxis = list(title = 'Neighborhood Group'),\n         yaxis = list(title = 'Average Price ($)'),\n         plot_bgcolor = 'white',\n         paper_bgcolor = 'white',\n         width = 600,\n         height = 600)\n\nHere is our visual for 2019:\n\nfig_2019\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is our visual for 2023:\n\nfig_2023"

The Bronx remains the most affordable, with the lowest prices for both markets in 2019 and 2023.\nGrowth in Pricing:\n\nFrom 2019 to 2023, median asking rents increased sharply in Manhattan (up $1,000) and Brooklyn (up $500), reflecting rising demand or increased cost of living in these areas.\n\nSimilarly, Airbnb prices rose by $20 in Manhattan and Brooklyn, aligning with these broader market trends.\n\nProportional Increases:\nAcross all boroughs, the percentage increases in Airbnb prices roughly correspond to increases in median asking rents, suggesting a direct relationship between the long-term rental market and short-term rental pricing.\nQueens and Staten Island Dynamics:\nBoth boroughs show moderate increases in Airbnb and median rent prices, maintaining their mid-tier affordability status within the city."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThe data clearly illustrate a strong link between median asking rents and Airbnb listing prices, with neighborhood group rankings remaining consistent over time. Manhattan and Brooklyn stand out as premium markets for both short-term and long-term rentals, driven by higher demand and rising costs. The significant price increases between 2019 and 2023 suggest broader economic and market changes, such as inflation, increased tourism, or heightened demand for housing in these areas. Further statistical analysis could provide deeper insights into the exact drivers behind these trends and their potential implications for renters and Airbnb hosts."
