<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This mini project walks you through how to prepare, clean, and analyze data. The project will be followed by a report on the subject analywed.</p>
<p>We are going to analyze the fiscal characteristics of major US public transit systems using data from the National Transit Database. The goal is to understand farebox recovery rates, analyze ridership, and examine the financial efficiency of various transit systems.</p>
<p>We will use data from the <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd">National Transit Database</a> as our primary source. In particular, since we want to analyze farebox revenues, total number of trips, total number of vehicle miles traveled, and total revenues and expenses by source, we will need to analyze several different tables:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/data-product/2022-annual-database-fare-revenues">2022 Fare Revenue</a> table</li>
<li>The latest <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/data-product/monthly-module-adjusted-data-release">Monthly Ridership</a> tables</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/data-product/2022-operating-expenses">2022 Operating Expenses</a> reports</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s start by cleaning the data.</p>
<section id="data-preparation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-preparation">Data Preparation</h2>
<p>The following code will download, clean, and join the tables.</p>

<p>The following code will rename the column ‘UZA Name’ to ‘metro_area’. Because it has no spaces in it, this name will be easier to manipulate in code.</p>

<p>The ‘Mode’ column is also helpful, but it uses a set of codes that aren’t interpretable. To make life easier for ourselves, let’s use a case_when statement to transform this into something we can make sense of.</p>
<p>First, let’s find the unique ‘Mode’ codes in our data using the distinct function. After examining the NTD website and finding the interpretations of these codes, we can complete the following snippet to recode the ‘Mode’ column.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="task-6-farebox-recovery-among-major-systems">Task 6: Farebox Recovery Among Major Systems</h3>
<p>Using the USAGE_AND_FINANCIALS table, answer the following questions:</p>
<p>Which transit system (agency and mode) had the most UPT in 2022? Which transit system (agency and mode) had the highest farebox recovery, defined as the highest ratio of Total Fares to Expenses? Which transit system (agency and mode) has the lowest expenses per UPT? Which transit system (agency and mode) has the highest total fares per UPT? Which transit system (agency and mode) has the lowest expenses per VRM? Which transit system (agency and mode) has the highest total fares per VRM? You may wish to restrict your answer to major transit systems, which you can define as those with 400,000 UPT per annum.</p>
